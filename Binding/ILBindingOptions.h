 Instances of this class represent the options for a binding (an ILBinding instance). You create one with the -init method (or the +optionsWithDefaultValues convenience method), then proceed to customize it.

For instance, setting an allowed thread automatically sets the concurrency model to kILBindingConcurrencyAllowedThread, and vice versa setting a different concurrency model means the allowedThread property is set to nil.
 
 Instances are copiable. All copies, whether made with -copy or -mutableCopy, are mutable.
