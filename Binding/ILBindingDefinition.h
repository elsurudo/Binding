 A binding definition describes how a binding should be built in a way that can be saved and loaded persistently. The Bindings Editor produces data for objects of this kind that can be then loaded at runtime.
 
 Binding definitions can produce property list representations of themselves, and produce new copies of themselves by reading the data in this representation. See the @ref propertyListRepresentation and @ref initWithPropertyListRepresentation:options:error: methods for details.
 
 Definitions of this class are immutable and opaque. You can create mutable copies of the ILMutableBindingDefinition class for editing.
